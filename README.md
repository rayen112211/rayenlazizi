## Hi, I’m Rayen 👋

I’m a full-stack web developer focused on building production-ready web applications.

I work across the full lifecycle:
- Frontend architecture (React / Next.js)
- Backend systems (Node.js, Python)
- Authentication, payments, dashboards
- SEO, performance, and deployment

I care about shipping clean, maintainable systems — not demos.
